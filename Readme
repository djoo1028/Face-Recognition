This code is face recognition code by implementing MATLAB. The purpose of this project is understanding meaning of PCA(Principal Component Analysis) 
and SVD(Singular Value Decomposition) algorithms in mathematical term. Apply this mathematical concepts one of the example of life application in 
Face recognition.
